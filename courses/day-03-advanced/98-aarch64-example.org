** Initialise nixpkgs

\\

   + Initialise ~nixpkgs~ with the correct ~crossSystem~
   + Pick this from ~lib.systems.examples~
   + Remember: You need to import ~<nixpkgs/lib>~ since, when
     initialising nixpkgs, you don't have _access_ to ~lib~ yet.

** Two ways to do cross compilation

** Option 1: ~callPackage~

\\

   + Use one of the packages you built yesterday (not NCDU - Zig
     doesn't support cross compilation in nixpkgs for some reason)
   + See if anything else is needed to make cross-compilation work

** Option 2: manually

\\

   + Select packages from pkgsBuildHost and pkgsHostTarget
   + Put them into buildInputs and nativeBuildInputs as appropriate
