#+Title: What even _is_ cross-compilation?
#+SETUPFILE: ../../reveal.setup

** Varied terms

\\

   Cross-compilation is the act of producing binaries for a "different
   system".

   There are two diffent ways this can apply.

** Cross operating system

\\

   For example: building an application on MacOS, for Linux.

   
** Cross CPU architecture

\\

   For example: building an application on x86_64 for aarch64.

** Some questions to keep in mind

\\

   + What is relevant for a build to succeed?
   + What is then needed by the output of this build?
   + Does the output of the build itself try to output more builds?
