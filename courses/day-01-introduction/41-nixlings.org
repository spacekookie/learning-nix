** Do you have Haskell experience?

   If not, Nix might seem a bit confusing to you!

\\

   Get experience _reading and writing Nix code_, without any
   packaging

** Why focus on basic syntax?

\\

   + Build up familiarity with the language
   + Learn how to solve general problems with Nix
   + Yes, Nix is a programming language

** 

   *Importantly*, examples are not packaging related!  The idea is to
   become familiar with Nix outside of a packaging context, which will
   make it easier to apply it in a packaging context later!

** Exercise structure

\\

   #+BEGIN_SRC nix
     {
       mkGreeting = greeting: towards: "${greeting} ${towards}";

       output = {
         message = # Invoke the above function so it returns "Hello Nixlings";
       };
     }
   #+END_SRC

   Run the examples with ~nix eval -f <file> output~
