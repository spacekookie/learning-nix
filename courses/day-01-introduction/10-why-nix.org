#+Title: Why Nix?
#+SETUPFILE: ../../reveal.setup

** There are a lot of package managers

\\

   virtualenv brew poetry pyenv pipenv rbenv rvm docker npm yarn composer
   cabal stack cargo rebar enot evm hex bower spago wasmer svm swivm
   jdk_switcher docker vms update-alternatives chroot luarocks luadist
   berrybrew ppm apt lein yum asdf ports winget chocolatey nvm pnpm
   rustup nuget cake paket

** How about system dependencies?

\\

   + Setup a build environment?
   + Install dependencies?
   + Find and link against the _right_ version of a library

**

** ... and that's just at dev time!

** It gets even trickier at deploy time

\\

   /docker, ansible, chef, puppet, .../

   
** Software is hard

\\

   + Our deploy targets are varied and numerous
   + No two systems are the same
   + How to keep track of dependencies?

   #+BEGIN_SRC console
      ❤ (theia) ~/smol> cat Cargo.lock | grep -F "[[package]]" | wc -l
      263

      ❤ (theia) ~/big> cat Cargo.lock | grep -F "[[package]]" | wc -l
      418
   #+END_SRC

** What do we depend on?

** Assorted other issues

\\

   + Distribution package managers can't package every library
   + Libraries that /are/ packaged can easily go out of date
   + Distribution stability guarantees are not always great for
     software development (and also misunderstood!)
   + Package managers keep track of symbolic names

** 

   *Most package managers are failing us, and so are most build tools!*

** 

   Nix solves the fundamental problem of dependencies
