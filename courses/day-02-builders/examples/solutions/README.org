#+Title: Excercise Solutions
#+SETUPFILE: ../../../../html.setup

This directory contains the solutions to the excercises from *day 2*.

Check [[../../README.org][day-02-builders]] for an overview!

** Tokei

This is a Rust application which can be built with
~rustPlatform.buildRustPackage~!

#+INCLUDE: "./tokei.nix" src nix

** Doge

This is a Python application which can be built with
~pythonPackages.buildPythonPackage~.  Note: th latest version of the
program isn't packaged on Pypi.  In this example we use ~fetchPypi~ to
demonstrate how it works, and thus _must_ use version 3.5.0.


#+INCLUDE: "./doge.nix" src nix

** Ncdu

This is a Zig and ncuses program.  We can use ~mkDerivation~ to build
it, but must customize the build environment slightly to accomodate
the Zig compiler's assumptions about what kind of system it is running
on (see comments in the file).
