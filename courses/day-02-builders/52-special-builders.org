#+Title: Special builders
#+SETUPFILE: ../../reveal.setup

** Do I really have to build my ~$LANG~ application by hand?

** No

** Remember ~build-support~ ?

\\

   + Commonly used languages have specific build support in nixpkgs
   + Pros: each builder can handle special cases
   + Cons: each builder handles special cases

** Rust builder

\\

   #+BEGIN_SRC nix
     rustPlatform.buildRustPackage rec {
       pname = "bat";
       version = "0.22.1";

       src = fetchFromGitHub {
         owner = "sharkdp";
         repo = pname;
         rev = "v${version}";
         sha256 = "sha256-ye6GH4pcI9h1CNpobUzfJ+2WlqJ98saCdD77AtSGafg=";
       };

       cargoSha256 = "sha256-ye6GH4pcI9h1CNpobUzfJ+2WlqJ98saCdD77AtSGafg=";

       ...
     }
   #+END_SRC

** Go builder

\\

   #+BEGIN_SRC nix
     buildGoModule rec {
       pname = "dive";
       version = "0.10.0";

       src = fetchFromGitHub {
         owner = "wagoodman";
         repo = pname;
         rev = "v${version}";
         sha256 = "sha256-1pmw8pUlek5FlI1oAuvLSqDow7hw5rw86DRDZ7pFAmA=";
       };

       vendorSha256 = "sha256-YPkEei7d7mXP+5FhooNoMDARQLosH2fdSaLXGZ5C27o=";
     }
   #+END_SRC

** Python builder

\\

   #+BEGIN_SRC nix
     buildPythonPackage rec {
       version = "0.7.5";
       pname = "pickleshare";

       src = fetchPypi {
         inherit pname version;
         sha256 = "87683d47965c1da65cdacaf31c8441d12b8044cdec9aca500cd78fc2c683afca";
       };
     }
   #+END_SRC

** 

   Not all specific builders are defined in ~build-support~ (that would be too boring).

   But a lot of them are.
